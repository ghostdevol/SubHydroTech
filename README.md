## 🌊 What is SubHydroTech?

**SubHydroTech** is a pressure-driven, submerged hydroelectric system designed to generate renewable electricity using compact, sealed tank units (such as soda kegs) with a turbine, valves, and pressure control systems.

The invention is optimized for off-grid, portable, or experimental hydroelectric setups. It functions using the core principles of:

- **Water pressure displacement**
- **Compact turbine generation**
- **Controlled valve-based flow**
- **Submerged pressure tank cycling**

## 🧠 Vision

SubHydroTech aims to:
- Empower low-cost hydro power experiments.
- Pioneer a pressure-based renewable generation method.
- Provide DIY engineers and researchers with a testable, modular unit.

## 🔩 System Blueprint

The current system uses the following components:

- Reinforced sealed tank (e.g., stainless soda keg)
- Inlet/output water channels
- Manual or solenoid valves
- Mini turbine (DC generator or stepper motor)
- Pressure gauge & release valve
- Optional: Arduino/ESP32 pressure control

A modular unit looks like this:
